# MaksDB

A Sharded Vector DB implemented with FAISS.

Currently uses Redis Pubsub for interprocess communication. 

Planned Updates:

- Change Redis Pubsub to Redis Streams for enhanced reliability
- Add support for replicas with a distributed consensus algorithm
- Develop a CLI  


Usage:

```bash
        $ redis-cli
        $ python3.12 test.py

```
